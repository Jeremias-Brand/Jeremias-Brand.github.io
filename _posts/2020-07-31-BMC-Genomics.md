The first chapter of my PhD Thesis is published! For this project I inherited a dataset produced before I joined the lab. 
The data consisted of a large RNA-Seq dataset for three *Macrostomum* species (*M. hystrix*, *M. spirale* and *M. pusillum*) with high sequencing depth across multiple biological conditions. We had RNA-Seq for adults, juveniles and regenerants. Regenerants are a mixture of animals collected at increasing time post amputation of the tail. It was clear from the beginning that we wanted to use annotations from *M. lignano* to annotate groups of orthologous genes and then look at rates of evolution and gene expression.
However, since the data was collected with the primary aim to produce high-quality transcriptomes, some of the biological conditions were not comparable between species. Specifically, we found that the *M. pusillum* juveniles were already quite advanced in development making the Hatchling - Adult contrast tricky to compare across the genus. You can see this in the picture below where gene expression between hatchlings and adults are compared. In both *M. hystrix* and *M. spirale* there is a large cloud to the right of the diagonal line representing transcripts with higher expression in adults, but in *M. pusillum* this cloud is shifted closer to the diagonal.

Because of this, we had to abandon our analysis of gene expression evolution and focused on sequence-based measures and homology detection failure. We transferred annotations from *M. lignano* to the other species, which allowed us to identify reproduction-related genes. Due to male-female coevolution genes should diverge rapidly but this has not been looked at in flatworms. We could show that reproduction-related genes have a higher sequence divergence and are also harder to detect with phylogenetic distance. 
Therefore, we can say that sexual selection likely also drives rapid evolution of these genes in flatworms. I am delighted we could find such an exciting result given the initial trouble with the data. You can read the paper [here](https://rdcu.be/b5tcA) if you want to learn more about this.

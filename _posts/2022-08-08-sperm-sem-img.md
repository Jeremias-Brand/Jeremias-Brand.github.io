Together with [Martin Oeggerli](http://oeggerli.com/) we have made some SEM images of sperm and Martin them arranged an colored them:
![Sperm of Macrostomum lignano and M. pusillum](https://jeremias-brand.github.io/img/20200228-2u4b_vs_4u2b-Sperm-001_025_180rot_finals_MB2.jpg)
We can see that the larger sperm of *M. lignano* has long protrusions called sperm bristles, while the smaller sperm of *M. pusillum* does not have them.
Our research indicates that these bristles are an adaptation to coevolution between sperm-donors and sperm-recipients. Indeed, we found that *Macrostomum* species have lost these bristles many times and these losses are correlated with a change from reciprocal to hypodermic mating.

title: Two new Macrostomum genomes
---

We have just published two new *Macrostomum* genome assemblies! 

Macrostomum flatworms - free-living and simultaneously hermaphroditic creatures - have become increasingly important models for studying regeneration, reproduction, and stem-cell function. The genome of *M. lignano*, the only species with a published genome assembly in this group, has paved the way for significant progress. However, its hidden polyploid nature - a result of recent whole-genome duplication and chromosome fusion events - presents significant challenges, often limiting the application of modern genetic tools. 

Responding to this need, we present robust genomic resources for *M. cliftonense* and *M. hystrix*, the two species that represent the genus' contrasting mating behaviors: reciprocal copulation and hypodermic insemination, respectively. By employing a combination of PacBio long-read sequencing and Illumina shot-gun sequencing, along with several RNA-Seq datasets, we have managed to assemble and annotate highly contiguous genomes for both species.

Both species have smaller genomes (227Mb and 220Mb) than *M. lignano* (764Mb) making them excellent targets for genetic work.

When groups of genes are together on the same chromosome they are called ‘in synteny’. Across distant animals such as Scallops, Vertebrates, and even Sponges and Jellyfish, synteny has been conserved.

However, some groups such as round worms or insects have shuffled their genes so much that we cannot detect these linkage groups anymore. Interestingly, in both groups new syntentic groupshave been established (e.g., Muller elements in *Drosophila*).

In our newest paper, investigated synteny in our beloved flatworms and found that while synteny is partially conserved in parasitics flatworms, it is not conserved in the planarian genus *Schmidtea* or the early-branching *Macrostomum hystrix*. On top of that synteny between the flatworm groups is also not conserved! So the worms apppear to continiously shuffle their genome and evolving without constraints on synteny.
In *Schmidtea* we found a high frequency of chromosomal rearrangements that appear to be associated with mobile transposable elements. That could provide a vital clue to why gene shuffling is common.

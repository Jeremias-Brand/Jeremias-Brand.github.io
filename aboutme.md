title: My research
---

I am an evolutionary biologist interested in sexual selection and its impact on animal morphology and ecological diversity. My research approach combines classical morphological observations with modern phylogenomics and comparative methods to investigate sexual selection and sexual conflict. I also have a keen interest in phylogenomic investigations of early Eukaryote and Lophotrochozoan evolution.

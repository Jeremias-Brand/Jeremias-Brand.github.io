We spent five years collecting and documenting flatworms across the globe. 
These two publications in @MPE and @EL summarize some of what we learned.

First, a bit of background. We work on _Macrostomum_ flatworms. These animals are tiny and transparent, which allows us to look inside their body using a microscope.




Most of the collected species are likely new to science and many have novel sexual traits.
We also found that traumatic insemination evolved frequently and involves drastic morphological changes.

We spent five years collecting and documenting flatworms across the globe. 
Here are the first two publication resulting from this effort! 
1. We present the first large-scale phylogenomic analysis of the our study genus _Macrostomum_. Through months of collection and with the help of many collaborators were could include 145 species. 

2. We show that HI has evolved several times 

Remarkably, 94 of the collected species are likely new to science,
highlighting that a large proportion of the diversity in this genus is yet to
be discovered. Our increased taxon sampling has not only yielded many
more species, but these additional species have also revealed a range of novel morphological traits. For example we found several species that have remarkably elongates sperm (C). Again others have several lateral sperm appendages (F), or a single flexible sperm bristle (D). The function of this variation in sperm is unclear. 


We also asked how the habitat diversity is distributed across the genus. We found that, eventhough many species occur in brackish water of low salinity, the invasion of freshwater probably happened only once. This is quite surprising since we find freshwater species on all continents, except antarctica. So they can either disperse acrosse oceans or have originated before the continetns split up.  
 appendages 

 When we do that we can see that they are simultaneous hermaphrodites. This means they have both testes and ovaries, allowing them to produce both sperm and eggs.

Macrostomum also have a fascinating diversity in sexual traits. Here you can see a phylogeny including all the 145 species we were able to collect together with my drawings of their male copulatory organ (stylet) and their sperm.

Here will be content about serial block face imaging 

*Macrostomum* flatworms are transparant which allows us to study they internal organs - in praticualr their genital morphology - in detail without the need for disections or histological preprations. However there always remains the lingering suspicioun that some important aspects of morphology might be missed because they are not easily visible in the light microscope. To adress this issue I am using a specialized electron microscopy technique called Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBFSEM) to produce serial sections of some animals. 
SBFSEM combines a standard SEM with a microtome that is mounted inside the microscope. The machine scans the block with the electron beam and the backscatter is then analyzed yieling images that can rival TEM quality.

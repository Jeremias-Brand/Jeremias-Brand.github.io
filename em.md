Here will be content about serial block face imaging 

*Macrostomum* flatworms are transparant which allows us to study they internal organs - in praticular their genital morphology - in detail without the need for disections or histological preprations. However there always remains the lingering suspicion that some important aspects of morphology might be missed because they are not easily visible in the light microscope. To adress this issue I am using a specialized electron microscopy technique called Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBFSEM) to produce serial sections of some animals and examine the genital morphology in more detail.
SBFSEM combines a standard SEM with a microtome that is mounted inside the microscope. The machine scans the block with the electron beam and the backscatter is then analyzed yieling images that can rival TEM quality. After scanning the microtome in the machine removes a slice and then repeates the process. This is nicely vizualized in this video from Gatan.

Using this technique we can get images of up to 7nm pixle size.

<picture of an entier worm in section.>

On this image we see a cross section through an entier animal. The thin spaghetti like appendages on the perifery of the animal are [cilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium) that cover the entier surface of the worms body. Smaller cilia are used for locomotion and beat in a synchronized wave front and larger cilia are immotile and are used for the detection of sensory stimulus. 
Below the cilia we see the epidermis cells with very prominent [nuclei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus). These nuclei are not round like in most other cells but multi lobed which sometimes gives them a strange appearance. Centrally we can also see some cilia again but this time they are actually on the inside ofthe animal ligning the gut. Cilia in the gut are longer than the ones on the epidermis and they are less synchronized in their beating. They are used to transport food particles up and down the digestive tract. 

<image of femal opening>
this image shows a cross section though the female genital opening. Note that it is also ciliated and the chamber below it (the femal antrum) also bears cilia.

Here we see the seminal vesicle. THis is where sperm is stored before copulation. The seminal vesicle is surounded by large circular musculature. 

<image of reconstructed stylet>
since the serial sections allow us to trace structures along the animal we an also reconstruct them. Here you can see a 3d reconstruction of the male copulatory organ - the stylet. It has quite a complex structure with a complicate slightly corkscrew shaped curve to it. From 2D images it is difficulte to completely grasp the sutelties of this turn but we can see it quite easily in the reconstruction. 
The stylet morphology varies drastically across the phylogeny as illustrated nicely when we compare the stylets of several species:

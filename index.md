Welcome to the Ambizione research group of Dr. Jeremias N. Brand. We are investigating the biodiversity of *Macrostomum* flatworms in East Africa to understand their evolutionary history and learn about the process of speciation. 

<h2>Why do some lineages diversify while others do not?</h2>

    <p>Adaptive radiations, a process characterized by rapid speciation combined with the emergence of a high diversity of habitats and morphological adaptations, have long been recognized as a key driver of biodiversity. Many such adaptive radiations occur when a species or group of species colonize a new environment, such as an island or lake. However, predicting which specific lineages will undergo adaptive radiations and discerning the extent to which they will do so present significant challenges. Though recognized as an essential factor, the mere presence of ecological opportunity does not necessarily predicate the occurrence of an adaptive radiation since many species closely related to a radiating one do not radiate. Among the best-studied adaptive radiations are the cichlid fishes in the African Great Lakes (AGL) region, particularly the massive cichlid assemblages in Lake Tanganyika, Lake Malawi, and Lake Victoria.
    Similarly, other taxa such as catfish, ostracods, gastropods, diatoms, and monogenean gill parasites of cichlids have also diversified in these lakes. However, these radiations have received much less attention than the cichlids, and the process leading to their diversification in this unique region remains to be explored. I have recently summarized molecular, ecological, and geographic evidence that suggests a radiation of Macrostomum flatworms has occurred in the region. In this project, we will intensely study the radiation via an ambitious sampling campaign across two countries and the three largest AGL. The main aim is to systematically collect biogeographic, molecular, ecological, and morphological data to determine the extent, size, and drivers of the *Macrostomum* radiation.</p>

    <p>In particular, we will study the contribution of the extrinsic environmental factors and the species' inherent intrinsic factors, such as the intensity of sexual selection or a species’ adaptations to the environment. This groundbreaking effort will be the first investigation of an adaptive radiation in free-living flatworms and substantially contribute to answering why speciation occurs in general.
    The direct comparison between the Macrostomum radiation and the exquisitely studied cichlid radiation is particularly interesting. In the case of the cichlids, the radiations have proceeded in stages, with species first expanding into macrohabitats, followed by microhabitats, and finally differentiating their colors due to sexual selection. We will use the Macrostomum system to elucidate if it also follows this stages-model. Furthermore, we will investigate how different mating systems affect speciation rate.</p>

  <h2>Meiofauna Ecology</h2>

  <p>I hypothesize that Macrostomum species, which mate via hypodermic insemination, a traumatic form of mating where sperm is injected through the epidermis of the partner, should have a low speciation rate due to the absence of antagonistic coevolution driving the emergence of precopulatory barriers and hence sympatric speciation. Previous work and preliminary data from Lake Tanganyika are consistent with this hypothesis, but incomplete taxon sampling has prevented firm conclusions. By focusing on a geographically restricted region, this project will be able to address this question conclusively and determine if intrinsic or extrinsic factors are more important. 
  Additionally, we will determine Macrostomum’s position in the food web, their adaptations to a life-style in sediment, and their population structures, resulting in insights about the ecology of microscopic animals, which have been rather neglected even though they are important components of sediment ecosystems. </p>
